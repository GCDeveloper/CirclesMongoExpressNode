# About
A canvas based project in which the user can create and drag yellow circles, and save/load them from a MongoDB.

# Instructions
1. Navigate to the root directory (where package.json exists) and run the following command on the command-line/terminal:

```
2. Make sure you have an installed MongoDB and that it is running in a seperate terminal, with mongod. Alternatively, change the dbURL inside app.js to point towards your chosen database.
